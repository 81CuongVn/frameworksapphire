# Welcome to the @sapphire/framework#{@branch} documentation

## Installing <a href={saphFrameworkUrl}>@sapphire/framework</a>

You can install this version of @sapphire/framework with one of the following commands:

**When using `npm`**

```sh
npm install @sapphire/framework
```

**When using `yarn`**

```sh
yarn add @sapphire/framework
```

**When using `pnpm`**

```sh
pnpm add @sapphire/framework
```

Note: Sapphire requires you to have Node.js 14.0.0 or higher, and Discord.js 12 or higher.

### Using @sapphire/framework

Create a file called `main.js` (or whatever you prefer) which will initiate and configure @sapphire/framework.

You can add this basic content, to create a new client:

```javascript
const { SapphireClient } = require('@sapphire/framework');

const client = new SapphireClient();

client.login('your-bot-token');
```

You can pass arguments to the {@link SapphireClient} constructor as an object. It can contain property from Discord.js'
<a href={djsClientOptions}>ClientOptions</a> as well as property from Sapphire.

> SapphireClientOptions are merged with <a href={djsUrl}>discord.js'</a> <a href={djsClientOptions}>ClientOptions</a>

## Running your bot

Once you have the basics set up run the following in your folder to start your bot:

```sh
node main.js
```

You won't have any feedback on your console, and the bot won't respond to any events in discord, but it is online!

## Preparing your file structure

You can now organize your project correctly by grouping files together in folders. This will allow it to scale more
easily as you add commands, events and other features.
The main folder, at the root of your project and containing all your code can be named `src` (for "source"). You can put
your `main.js` file inside this `src` directory and check that your bot still boots when you run

```sh
node src/main.js
```

Your file structure should now look like this:

```
node_modules/
src/
  └── main.js
package-lock.json
package.json
```
